# RandomCatBot

A **Random Facebook Bot**, that uploads **Cat Photos** every 20 minutes.

This is an example of my API written in Python for content creation automation, [Python Easy Facebook API](https://github.com/seokkuuu/python_easy_facebook_api)

# Installation

- You must add the following environment variables, I explain how to get this in the `README` of the [Python Easy Facebook API](https://github.com/seokkuuu/easy_python_facebook_api) repo.

  - `PAGE_ID` This means the Facebook Page API, obviously this is the ID of the page to upload the cat posts.
  - `TOKEN` This means the Facebook Page Access Token.

- Install the poetry modules specified in [this file](./pyproject.toml)

- Run the `main.py` file, with `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` or `py main.py`.
